    """
    In an interconnected global economy, geopolitical risks, from trade disputes to regional conflicts, can
    critically disrupt supply chains, causing costly delays and inefficiencies. Recent crises such as 
    the COVID-19 pandemic, Brexit, and the Russia-Ukraine conflict have underscored the need for more 
    **proactive** and **resilient** supply chain strategies.

    **aegis** is designed to help supply chain managers and decision-makers systematically 
    monitor, analyze, and anticipate disruptions **before** they escalate. Leveraging GPT-powered analysis, 
    it focuses on **geopolitical events** that may impact suppliers, transportation routes, and crucial 
    network nodes.

# Overview of Workflow / Step-by-Step
st.header("How aegis Works")

st.markdown(
    """
    aegis offers **four main steps** to move from raw data collection to final risk scores:

    1. **Events & News**  
       Fetch events from external news sources. 
       This step gathers potential disruptions tied to keywords or topics of interest.

    2. **Assess Events**  
       Evaluate which events truly matter to the given network. aegis uses GPT-based relevance
       analysis to filter events and assign risk levels (likelihood, impact), storing only those events that could 
       disrupt the given supply chain.

    3. **Map & Supply Chain Visualization**  
       Overlay assessed events onto an interactive map of the supply chain. 
       Quickly spot potential trouble spots or critical links facing threats.

    4. **Risk Dashboard & Analysis**  
       Compute high-level Bayesian risk scores per category (e.g., Geopolitical, Financial, etc.) 
       and visualize them in a radar or bar chart. This gives an **overall** picture of 
       the supply chainâ€™s health and where vulnerabilities may lie.
